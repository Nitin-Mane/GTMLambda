GTMLambda is a powerful text generative model built on the Lambda Transformer architecture. This GitHub repository provides code for training and fine-tuning the model on various text generation tasks, along with pre-trained checkpoints for immediate use.

In this stage the Aurora model is under progress and will update the progress shortly.
